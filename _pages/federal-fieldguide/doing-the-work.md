## Doing the work
The following sections identify challenges and strategies to reduce risk during the post-award phase of custom technology projects in government.

**Challenge:** Traditional post-award kick-off meetings usually do not adequately engage or prepare the contractor to begin work.

#### Executive Summary
A thoughtful post-award kick-off meeting should introduce new team members, empower the government product owner, plan next steps, and get the team excited about the upcoming work.

#### Recommendations

[FAR Part 42.5](https://www.acquisition.gov/content/part-42-contract-administration-and-audit-services#i1075565) encourages Contracting Officers (COs) to hold a post-award kick-off meeting with the winning contractor. That is often treated somewhere between a check-box exercise and an afterthought.

We recommend being more intentional about the kick-offs, either as one combined meeting (contractual + project) or as two separate meetings scheduled in close proximity to one another. Some Contracting Officers have strong feelings about their procedures for a FAR-required kickoff, and prefer to hold their own separate meeting.

Goals of a post-award kick-off:

- **Make introductions:** Start building a new team by getting everybody acquainted.

- **Share vision:** Make sure everyone understands the work's purpose and impact.

- **Establish roles:** Determine who will play what role on the agency and contractor teams; clarify the lanes for the Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), and product owner (PO); outline escalation paths. 

- **Publicly empower the product owner**: Make it clear to the team that the product owner is empowered to make decisions, that they are the agency's go-to person, and that the agency expects the product to evolve over time through learning and iteration with users.

- **Make time for the contractual kick-off:** If this is held as a single meeting, cover whatever the CO would like to discuss --- this can include security, legal concerns, and the COR's and the CO's contractual responsibilities. 

- **Establish initial working practices:** Discuss folks' preferred communication methods and working hours; plan tools and technology.

- **Plan next steps:** Pick a few action-oriented tasks that get the team started on a positive cadence (e.g. scheduling Agile cadence, user research, technical prototype, etc.)

- **Get folks excited:** Set the relationship off on the right foot, with the team leaving excited and energized.

To align both the government and the vendor, consider these things when planning a kick-off:

-   **Attendance:** Who will attend?

-   **Leadership involvement:** Does an agency leader want to kick off the meeting by saying a few words (e.g. underpinning the importance of this initiative, publicly empowering the PO, etc.)?

-   **Stakeholder management:** Who needs time on the agenda? Who needs to feel heard?

-   **Agency preference:** 

    -   Does the agency have a policy for contract kick-offs?

    -   How does the CO/program office usually handle kick-offs?

    -   Would they like to have one meeting (combining the contractual kick-off and team kick-off) or two (separating these meetings)?

        -   What does the CO want to cover in the meeting (to prevent duplication)?

    -   How long are kick-offs, typically? Are they held in-person or virtually? If in-person, and the contractor is remote or distributed, how can these meetings accommodate remote contractors?

-   **Contractor preference:** Is there anything that the contractor would like to highlight/include in the agenda? 

-   **Facilitator:** Who will facilitate the discussion?

Thinking through these goals and considerations should help make the kick-off productive and energizing.
